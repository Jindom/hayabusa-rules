description: Excel called wmic to finally proxy execute regsvr32 with the payload.
  An attacker wanted to break suspicious parent-child chain (Office app spawns LOLBin).But
  we have command-line in the event which allow us to "restore" this suspicious parent-child
  chain and detect it. Monitor process creation with "wmic process call create" and
  LOLBins in command-line with parent Office application processes.
detection:
  SELECTION_1:
    ParentCommandLine:
    - '*regsvr32*'
    - '*rundll32*'
    - '*msiexec*'
    - '*mshta*'
    - '*verclsid*'
  SELECTION_2:
    Image: '*\wbem\WMIC.exe'
  SELECTION_3:
    ParentCommandLine: '*wmic *'
  SELECTION_4:

    - '*powerpnt.exe'
  SELECTION_5:
    ParentCommandLine: '*process*'
  SELECTION_6:
    ParentCommandLine: '*create*'
  SELECTION_7:
