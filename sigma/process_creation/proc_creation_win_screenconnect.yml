description: "An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software,\
  \ such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive\
  \ command and control channel to target systems within networks.\nThese services\
  \ are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed\
  \ by application control within a target environment.\nRemote access tools like\
  \ VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate\
  \ software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)\
