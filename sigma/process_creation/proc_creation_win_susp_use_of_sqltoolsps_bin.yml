title: SQL Client Tools PowerShell Session Detection

description: This rule detects execution of a PowerShell code through the sqltoolsps.exe
  utility, which is included in the standard set of utilities supplied with the Microsoft
  SQL Server Management studio. Script blocks are not logged in this case, so this
  utility helps to bypass protection mechanisms based on the analysis of these logs.
detection:
  SELECTION_1:
    Image: '*\sqltoolsps.exe'
  SELECTION_2:
    ParentImage: '*\sqltoolsps.exe'
  SELECTION_3:
    OriginalFileName: \sqltoolsps.exe
  SELECTION_4:
    ParentImage: '*\smss.exe'
  condition: ((SELECTION_1 or SELECTION_2 or SELECTION_3) and  not (SELECTION_4))
falsepositives:
- Direct PS command execution through SQLToolsPS.exe is uncommon, childprocess sqltoolsps.exe
  spawned by smss.exe is a legitimate action.
