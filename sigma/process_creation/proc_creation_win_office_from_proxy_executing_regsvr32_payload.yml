description: Excel called wmic to finally proxy execute regsvr32 with the payload.
  An attacker wanted to break suspicious parent-child chain (Office app spawns LOLBin).But
  we have command-line in the event which allow us to "restore" this suspicious parent-child
  chain and detect it. Monitor process creation with "wmic process call create" and
  LOLBins in command-line with parent Office application processes.
