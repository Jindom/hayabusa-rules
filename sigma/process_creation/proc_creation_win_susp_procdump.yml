author: Florian Roth
date: 2021/02/02
description: Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by using
  a special command line parameter ' -ma ' and ' -accepteula' in a single step. This
  way we're also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the procdump
  executable.
detection:
  SELECTION_1:
    CommandLine: '* -ma *'
  SELECTION_2:
    CommandLine: '* -accepteula *'
  condition: (SELECTION_1 and SELECTION_2)
falsepositives:
- Another tool that uses the command line switches of Procdump
- Legitimate use of procdump by a developer or administrator
