  definition: Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
    config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular sysmon
    configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but it is worth
    verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,
    https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular. How to test detection? You can
    always use Cobalt Strike, but also you can check powershell script from this site
